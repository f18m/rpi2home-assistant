# DEPENDENCIES
# 1) since Renovate bot is used, it's best to pin dependency versions; 
#    see https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/poetry/
# 2) reference docs for each dependency:
#  aiomqtt ->    https://sbtinstruments.github.io/aiomqtt/
#  SM16inpind -> https://github.com/SequentMicrosystems/16inpind-rpi/tree/main/python
#  PyYAML ->     https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation
#  gpiozero ->   https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
#  DEPRECATED: RPi.GPIO ->   https://pythonhosted.org/RPIO/   (backend for gpiozero)
#              As of March 2024, RPI.GPIO does not work anymore on latest Raspbian, see https://github.com/gpiozero/gpiozero/issues/1136
#              So I had to switch to pigpio, which however needs a daemon to be running to work (!!!)
