# ** Opto-isolated Inputs Configuration **
#
# These inputs are those sampled by the Sequent Microsystem 16ch-optoinsulated board; they are exposed as binary_sensors
# into Home Assistant.
# More details:
# - the inputs are numbered 1-based, just like in the silk-screen printing on the board itself
# - the MQTT topics published will be in the form "<default_topic_prefix>/<name>", where <default_topic_prefix> is
#   configured by 'home_assistant.default_topic_prefix'
# - to improve security/robustness it's suggested to set the "<entry>.home_assistant.expire_after" property;
#   rpi2home-assistant will continuously update (send messages on) the MQTT topics for opto-isolated inputs 
#   at the frequency configured by 'home_assistant.publish_period_msec'. Thus it's suggested to set the "expire_after"
#   to 2x or 3x times the value of the 'home_assistant.publish_period_msec' key.
# - the key '<entry>.home_assistant.platform' can only accept the value "binary_sensor" so far 
#   and since it's the default value, it can be omitted
# - Home Assistant MQTT discovery messages are automatically published if 'home_assistant.discovery_messages.enable' is
#   set to 'true'

# ** GPIO Inputs Configuration **
#
# These inputs are those sampled by the Raspberry directly using its own GPIO pins (3.3V compatible).
# A fundamental difference with 'i2c_optoisolated_inputs' is that the MQTT topics configured
# for these GPIO inputs are updated with a message only when the GPIO transition from "inactive -> active"
# is detected. If no "inactive -> active" transitions are detected, no MQTT messages are published.
# Another fundamental difference is that these GPIOs do not create any HomeAssistant entity.
# The MQTT topic will be in the form "<topic>" and will receive the configured "<payload>".
gpio_inputs:
  - name: radio_channel_a
    description: Radio Channel A
    gpio: 27
    active_low: false
    mqtt:
      topic: alarmo/command
      payload: ARM_AWAY
    # NO 'home_assistant' dictionary here... reason is that the 'gpio_inputs' do not produce any
    # HomeAssistant entity. They just trigger the publish of a particular payload on a particular topic... 
    # at least so far

#
# ** Output Channels Configuration **
#
# These outputs channels are just Raspberry GPIO pins configured as outputs.
# They are exposed as 'switch' or 'button' entities into Home Assistant.
# More details:
# - the 'active_low=false' property indicates that when the <payload_on> is received over MQTT, then the
#   GPIO pin should be driven HIGH (3.3V); when the <payload_off> (or nothing) is received over MQTT, then the
#   GPIO pin should be driven LOW (ground). The 'active_low=true' property inverts the behavior;
# - the MQTT topic subscribed will be in the form "<default_topic_prefix>/<name>", where <default_topic_prefix> is
#   configured by 'home_assistant.default_topic_prefix'
# - the MQTT topic "<default_topic_prefix>/<output name>/state" is automatically updated after confirming that the output 
#   GPIO pin has successfully changed status
# - Home Assistant MQTT discovery messages are automatically published if 'home_assistant.discovery_messages.enable=true'
# - The '<entry>.home_assistant.platform' key can be either 'switch' (the default) or 'button'. 
#   In case 'button' is chosen and the '<entry>.mqtt.payload_on' message is received over MQTT, then the GPIO output 
#   is turned ON (respecting 'active_low' property) and 500msec later it is turned OFF (momentary press).
#   In case 'switch' is chosen, then whenever the '<entry>.mqtt.payload_on' message is received, the GPIO output is turned ON
#   (respecting 'active_low' property) and whenever the '<entry>.mqtt.payload_off' message is received, the GPIO output is turned OFF.
